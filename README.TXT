TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is discussed in chapter 6.

This project aims to implements a technical support system for customers of 
the DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

This project is only a first, rudimentary step towards the full solution.

24) A HashMap is a data structure in Java that implements the Map interface.
  -The main purpose of it is to store associations objects in key-value pairs
  - THe hashMap is used by putting a unique key into the map with a specific value by associating it
  
25) - key, put and get methods for example.
    - Yes i think that they can be used for both parameters.
    

26) Calling a method that returns the map's current size.

28) The new value overwrites the old value stored within that key.

29) Both entries are stored in the map.

30) with a method called containsKey(key);
if (map.containsKey("apple")) {
    System.out.println("Key is there");
} else {
    System.out.println("Key is not there");

31) Null

32) using the KeySet method and then using the iterate method in the collection.

33)

34) Arraylist allows duplications, has a list and has insertion order. Hashmap is the opposite.

35) ArrayList preserves the order and duplicates, Hashmap removes duplicates and does not have order.

36) No problems, thats because trim method is used.
